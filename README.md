   # 🚀 TaskFlow: Zero-Cost Multicloud DevOps Pipeline

A secure, containerized Node.js API deployed across **Azure** and **GCP** using **CI/CD**, **infrastructure-as-code**, and **security scanning** — all within **free-tier limits**.

> ⚠️ **Azure App Service** was validated and then **deleted** to maintain **$0 operational cost**.

## 🎯 Goal

Demonstrate **true multicloud parity** by deploying the **same Docker image** to:
- **Azure App Service** (Linux Container, West Europe)
- **GCP Cloud Run** (Serverless, us-central1)

All while enforcing:
- ✅ **Security scanning** (Trivy + `npm audit`)
- ✅ **Immutable infrastructure** (same image, same tag)
- ✅ **Zero long-term cost** (free tiers only)
